## Description

_Kamihime Item Management_ - (In Development) Levels your weapons, levels
your eidolons, skills your weapons, skills your grails, and sells your N
rarity weapons and eidolons.

**Go to Enhance through My Page to run scripts that have been defined by
options near the beginning of the script. Press F12 to open developer tools
and check the console tab to view script progress.**

Check near the beginning of the script to modify what gets done in what
order and to set options on whether SR weapons or eidolons get leveled,
whether SR weapons get skill leveled after the SSRs, and whether cherub
weapons or rare eidolons get sold.

Thanks to shilba for sharing scripts. I wouldn't have found how to use the
game's API on my own.
